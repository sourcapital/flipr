## Kubernetes

### Deployment

#### Add to Cluster

Set all environment variables in `k8s-deployment.yaml` and deploy the application:

```
kubectl create -f k8s-deployment.yaml
```

#### Remove from Cluster

Remove the application from the Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl delete -f k8s-deployment.yaml
```

### Prometheus Metrics Server

You can access all metrics via the `/metrics` endpoint. To scrape these metrics with your Prometheus instance, add the following job to your `prometheus.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'flipr'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['flipr.chainflip']
```

## Systemd Service

### Prerequisites

- `node` (v16.17): Install it via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- `yarn`: Install it via `npm install -g yarn`

### Build

Clone this repository to your machine and run:

```shell
cd flipr
yarn install
yarn build
```

#### Create a systemd Service File

Open a new service file in an editor with root permissions:

```shell
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/flipr.service
```

Copy and paste the following content:

```unit file (systemd)
[Unit]
Description=Flipr

[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

Environment="NODE_ENV=production"
Environment="BETTERSTACK_API_KEY=XXX"
Environment="LOGS_SOURCE_TOKEN=XXX"
Environment="CHAINFLIP_NODE_ADDRESS=XXX"
Environment="NODE_ENDPOINT_CHAINFLIP=XXX"
Environment="NODE_ENDPOINT_BITCOIN=XXX"
Environment="NODE_ENDPOINT_ETHEREUM=XXX"
Environment="NODE_ENDPOINT_POLKADOT=XXX"

ExecStart={NODE_INSTALLATION_PATH} {DIRECTORY_PATH}/dist/main.js

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Set all required environment variables and replace:

- `NODE_INSTALLATION_PATH`: Path to your `node` binary
- `DIRECTORY_PATH`: Path to the this project directory

#### Set Environment Variables

Replace the environment variables with your environment variables.

#### Reload systemd

After creating the service file, inform systemd of the new service:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

#### Enable and Start the Service

To make sure the service starts on boot:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable flipr
```

#### Start the service with

```shell
sudo systemctl start flipr
```

#### Checking the Service Status

You can check the status of your service at any time with:

```shell
sudo systemctl status flipr
```

#### Logs

If you want to monitor the application logs:

```shell
sudo journalctl -f -u flipr
```

This will show real-time logs of the flipr service.

#### Stopping and Restarting

If you need to stop or restart the service:

```
sudo systemctl stop flipr
sudo systemctl restart flipr
```

## Local Environment

### Installation

Install all the required dependencies from `package.json`:

```
yarn install
```

### Build

Compile `.ts` to `.js`:

```
yarn build
```

### Run

Run via `node.js`:

```
yarn start
```

## BetterStack (optional)

### Uptime

BetterStack Uptime is used for alerting and incident management.

- Heartbeats are sent every minute for `Health` and `Sync Status` of the nodes
- Missed heartbeats create incidents
- Kubernetes pod restarts create incidents
- Low reputation create incidents
- Penalties create incidents
- Outdated Chainflip node versions creates incidents

#### API Key

Sign up at [betterstack.com](https://uptime.betterstack.com/?ref=8l7f) and follow the [docs](https://betterstack.com/docs/uptime/api/getting-started-with-uptime-api/) to get the API key.

### Logs (optional)

BetterStack Logs is used for log manangement and dashboard visualization.

- Flipr forwards its own logs
- k8s `error` and `warn` logs are also forwarded

#### Source Token

Sign up at [betterstack.com](https://logs.betterstack.com/?ref=8l7f) and follow the [docs](https://betterstack.com/docs/logs/logging-start/) to get a source token for the platform `JavaScript ‚Ä¢ Node.js`.
