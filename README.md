## Kubernetes

### Deploy to Cluster

Set all environment variables in `k8s-deployment.yaml` and deploy the application:

```
kubectl create -f k8s-deployment.yaml
```

### Remove from Cluster

Remove the application from the Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl delete -f k8s-deployment.yaml
```

## Local Environment

### Installation

Install all the required dependencies from `package.json`:

```
yarn install
```

### Build

Compile `.ts` to `.js`:

```
yarn build
```

### Run

Run via `node.js`:

```
yarn start
```

## BetterStack

### Uptime

BetterStack Uptime is used for alerting and incident management.

- Heartbeats are sent every minute for `Health` and `Sync Status` of the nodes
- Missed heartbeats create incidents
- Kubernetes pod restarts create incidents
- Low reputation create incidents
- Penalties create incidents
- Outdated Chainflip node versions creates incidents

#### API Key

Sign up at [betterstack.com](https://uptime.betterstack.com/?ref=8l7f) and follow the [docs](https://betterstack.com/docs/uptime/api/getting-started-with-uptime-api/) to get the API key.

### Logs (optional)

BetterStack Logs is used for log manangement and dashboard visualization.

- Flipr forwards its own logs
- k8s `error` and `warn` logs are also forwarded

#### Source Token

Sign up at [betterstack.com](https://logs.betterstack.com/?ref=8l7f) and follow the [docs](https://betterstack.com/docs/logs/logging-start/) to get a source token for the platform `JavaScript ‚Ä¢ Node.js`.
